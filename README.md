# python-api-challenge

I utilized class examples and their included sample code to work this challenge. I also used some resource pages from python and hvplot to assist with some code missing from the class assignments. 

The location of my csv file would not update from my local machine to the git file in my VacationPy file. I was able to update the location on the WeatherPy file.
